# Development and Update Process

## Investment Card Component Changes

The Investment Card component has been redesigned to focus on only the most essential information:

1. **Name** - The investment type name is prominently displayed at the top
2. **Description** - A brief description of the investment type
3. **Taxability** - Whether the investment is taxable or tax-exempt
4. **Return Type** - The type of return (normal, fixed, or gbm)
5. **Update Time** - When the investment was last updated

The redesigned card is more focused and cleaner, removing unnecessary elements like:

- User avatar
- Investment value
- All icons and decorative elements

## Investment Detail Modal Changes

The Investment Detail Modal has been updated to display comprehensive information about investment types as defined in the project requirements. The modal now displays:

1. **Basic Information:**

   - Name
   - Description
   - Last update time

2. **Return & Income Details:**

   - Expected annual return (change in underlying value)
     - Displayed as a fixed amount/percentage or as a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation
   - Expected annual income from dividends or interest
     - Displayed in the same format as the expected annual return
   - Expense ratio
     - A fixed percentage of the value subtracted annually by the provider

3. **Tax Information:**
   - Taxability status (tax-exempt or taxable)
   - Explanatory notes about tax implications

## Icon Removal Update

In the latest update, we completely removed all icons from the investment components to:

1. Further simplify the user interface
2. Reduce visual clutter
3. Create a more minimalist, text-focused design
4. Improve loading performance by reducing the need to load icon libraries

The removed icons include:

- Calendar icons for dates
- Section indicator icons
- Information and explanation icons
- Tax status and type indicator icons

This change continues our focus on a clean, data-oriented interface that prioritizes content over decoration.

## Add New Investment Window Redesign

The "Add New Investment" window has been completely redesigned to align with our minimalist approach and to make the investment creation process more intuitive:

1. **Streamlined Stepwise Process:**

   - The form now follows a logical step-by-step wizard interface
   - Users progress through Basic Info, Return Details, Income & Tax, and Review steps
   - Each step is focused on a specific aspect of the investment type

2. **Enhanced Information Context:**

   - Added informative text throughout to help users understand each field
   - Context-sensitive help appears for complex fields like return distributions
   - Input validation ensures all required information is provided

3. **Removed Icon Selection:**

   - Consistent with our icon removal strategy, the icon selection grid has been removed
   - Focus is now entirely on the investment's financial characteristics

4. **Required Fields Implementation:**

   - Name and description are mandatory
   - Financial details have sensible defaults to prevent invalid values
   - The Review step presents a comprehensive summary before saving

5. **Conditional Fields:**
   - Standard deviation inputs only appear when a normal distribution is selected
   - Tax-exempt investments show additional guidance about not using them in retirement accounts

6. **Flexible Value Input Options:**
   - Return rates can now be specified as either percentages or fixed dollar amounts
   - Annual income can be specified as either percentages or fixed dollar amounts
   - Input ranges, steps, and labels dynamically adjust based on the selected input method
   - The review screen clearly indicates whether values are percentages or fixed amounts

The redesigned Add Investment window creates a more guided, educational experience that helps users create properly configured investment types with all required attributes.

## Investment Dashboard Update

The Investment Dashboard and related components have been updated to properly handle and display both percentage-based and fixed amount investments:

1. **Investment Detail Modal Enhancement:**
   - The detail modal now intelligently displays either percentage or dollar values based on the investment's configuration
   - Labels automatically adjust to show "Return Rate" vs "Return Amount" depending on the input mode
   - Descriptions are contextually relevant to the selected input type
   - Standard deviation information is formatted appropriately (% or $) based on the input mode

2. **Dashboard Integration:**
   - The main dashboard now properly handles investments with different input modes
   - Sample investment data includes examples of both percentage and fixed amount returns
   - Investment cards maintain a consistent appearance regardless of the underlying value representation

3. **Type Definition Updates:**
   - Created ValueInputMode enum to standardize handling of percentage vs. fixed amount inputs
   - Updated Investment interface to include returnInputMode and dividendInputMode properties
   - Ensured consistent type usage across all components

These updates ensure that users can meaningfully compare investments regardless of how their returns are calculated, while maintaining a clean, consistent interface.

## Interactions

- Users can view basic information about investment types on the cards in the main dashboard
- When a user clicks on a card, the detail modal pops up showing all available information about that investment type
- The detail modal is organized in sections for better readability and comprehension

This redesign improves the user experience by:

1. Simplifying the initial view to focus on the most important attributes
2. Providing comprehensive details on demand
3. Organizing information in a logical and accessible manner
4. Reducing visual noise by removing decorative icons

## Future Improvements

- Add the ability to filter and sort investments based on their attributes
- Implement responsive design improvements for smaller screens
- Add visual charts to illustrate return distributions for "normal" return types
