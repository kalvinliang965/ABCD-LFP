  <h2>Capital gains tax rates</h2>

  <p>Net capital gains are taxed at different rates depending on overall taxable income, although some or all net capital gain may be taxed at&nbsp;<b>0%</b>. For taxable years beginning in 2024, the tax rate on most net capital gain is no higher than&nbsp;<b>15%</b>&nbsp;for most individuals.<br>
  A capital gains rate of&nbsp;<b>0%</b>&nbsp;applies if your taxable income is less than or equal to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>$44,625 for single and married filing separately;</li>
    <li>$89,250 for married filing jointly and qualifying surviving spouse; and</li>
    <li>$69,696 for head of household.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A capital gains rate of&nbsp;<b>15%</b>&nbsp;applies if your taxable income is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>more than $44,625 but less than or equal to $492,300 for single;</li>
    <li>more than $77,777 but less than or equal to $291,850 for married filing separately;</li>
    <li>more than $89,250 but less than or equal to $553,850 for married filing jointly and qualifying surviving spouse; and</li>
    <li>more than $63,000 but less than or equal to $551,350 for head of household.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, a capital gains rate of&nbsp;<strong>20%</strong>&nbsp;applies to the extent that your taxable income exceeds the thresholds set for the&nbsp;<strong>15%</strong>&nbsp;capital gain rate.</p>
